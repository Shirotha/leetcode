/*
    A peak element is an element that is strictly greater than its neighbors.

    Given a 0-indexed integer array nums, find a peak element, and return its index. If the array contains multiple peaks, return the index to any of the peaks.

    You may imagine that nums[-1] = nums[n] = -âˆž. In other words, an element is always considered to be strictly greater than a neighbor that is outside the array.

    You must write an algorithm that runs in O(log n) time.

    Constraints:

    1 <= nums.length <= 1000
    -2^31 <= nums[i] <= 2^31 - 1
    nums[i] != nums[i + 1] for all valid i.
